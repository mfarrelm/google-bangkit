# Booking Cancellations prediction
We try to build a neural network model for a bookings cancellation prediction.\
The model is trained using hotel booking demand dataset use several information from the dataset such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children and/or babies.\
The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)\
We hope this model can help hotel industries management to improve its business metrics using this predictions, and understand what are the key factors that determine whether a booking will be canceled or not\
